dSPI is a vanilla industry stockpiling NewGRF for OpenTTD.

Industries are altered so that cargo is produced periodically by drawing on
their input stockpile. If you fill up the stockpile, the industry will refuse
delivery and you won't get paid!

However, industries with a healthy stockpile and good level of transported cargo
will ramp up production allowing you to deliver more!


## Features
  * Stockpiling secondary and tertiary industries (temperate only)
  * Smooth economy style production changes
  * Power plant production tied to industry demand
  * Secondary industry power requirements (enabled via parameter)

With hopefully more [to come](TODO.md)!
