# TODO
Things to do, ordered roughly by importance. Nothing here is set in stone and
this list will be subject to many changes.

## Short Term
* Playtest production rate changes
* Playtest power requirements
* Unit conversion for displayed stockpile
* Implement multiple power stations per town

## Medium Term
* Fix Power Plant animation
    * Re-enable chimney and sparking animation
    * Stop animations if no fuel or demand
* Reimplement optional features from [BSPI.grf](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=84735)?
    * Valuables requirements to boost primary industries
    * Reserves for extractive industries
    * Fertility for organic industries
* Temperate Bank, two options:
    * production correlates to town size, or
    * act like a secondary industry

## Possible Ideas
* Power Plant: Allow closure?
* Power Plant: Base demand based on town population?
* Temperate Farm: Make Grain and Livestock production rate the same?
* Temperate Oil Wells: Remove IND_FLAG_NO_PRODUCTION_INCREASE?
* Add support for all default landscapes/climates
    * Water Tower: Consumption correlates to town size
    * Toy Shop: Consumption correlates to town size?
* Secondary Industries: Randomise initial production rate?
* Parameter for production change frequency?
    * Standard, Keen, or Zealous/Intense/Fervid
