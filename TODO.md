# TODO
Things to do, ordered roughly by importance. Nothing here is set in stone and
this list will be subject to many changes.

* Implement and test production rate changes
    * Add stockpile level to rate change calculation
* Investigate random functions
    * I'm sure there's distribution or fencepost issues in there
* Extra cargo inputs for:
    * Steel Mill: Iron Ore and Coal
        * Apparently the real life ratio of Ore:Coal is 2:1 [^1][^2]
    * Power Station: Coal and Oil
<br/>
<br/>
* Reimplement optional features from [BSPI.grf](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=84735)
    * Power requirements for secondary industries
    * Valuables requirements to boost primary industries
    * Reserves for extractive industries
    * Fertility for organic industries
* Ensure above features have an entry in the change parameters dialog box
<br/>
<br/>
* Add support for all default landscapes/climates
* Economy type toggle?
* Randomise initial production rate?
